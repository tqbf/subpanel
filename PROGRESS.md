learned, what surprised you (`SWIFTUI-RULES.md` §10.1). Newest at the top.

## 2026-06-28 — Metabolized learnings from the first app on this template

Folded `LEARNINGS.md` (general lessons from building the first app — an
outdoor-weather feature — on this scaffold) into the permanent docs, then
deleted the copy. Where each landed:

- `SWIFTUI-RULES.md` **§5.6** — `foregroundStyle` resolves innermost-wins (a
  tinted container can host a differently-colored inline child; the corollary
  bites the "explicit `.foregroundStyle(.primary)`" habit).
- `SWIFTUI-RULES.md` **§11 Swift Charts** (new) — overlaid lines need distinct
  `series:` or they merge into one path; the x-domain is the union of all
  plotted data, so clip overlays to the primary series' window.
- `SWIFTUI-RULES.md` **§12 Concurrency** (new) — a `@MainActor` type adopting a
  delegate protocol needs an isolated conformance (`@MainActor CLLocationManagerDelegate`).
- `plans/build-system.md` — new "Permissions & capabilities" section: usage
  prompts work in this ad-hoc-signed, no-Xcode bundle given the right
  `NS…UsageDescription` keys; the sandbox decides whether a `com.apple.security.*`
  entitlement is also needed; always design the denied path.

Appended §11/§12 rather than renumbering so the existing §9/§10 cross-references
in `PLAN.md` / `PROGRESS.md` stay valid.

## 2026-06-28 — Template scaffold (the "Starter" baseline)

Built the template this repo ships as:

- **Build system** lifted from the Casette app's SwiftPM-only setup and
  generalized: `Package.swift` (one exe + one test target, Swift 6 mode, no
  deps), `build.sh` (swift build → `.app` → codesign, ad-hoc fallback),
  `Makefile` (build/check/test/run/install + sign→notarize→staple→zip `dist`
  pipeline), `Resources/Info.plist`, sandboxed `Starter.entitlements`,
  `scripts/make-icon.swift` (pure-CoreGraphics doc-and-table glyph).
- **App**: `NavigationSplitView` with a `SidebarSection` enum driving a lorem
  reading column (`ReadingView`, measure-capped) and a native sortable `Table`
  (`DataTableView`) with a reusable `StatusBadge` and a footer count. State in
  one `@Observable @MainActor AppModel`; type/metrics centralized in `Theme`.
- **`scripts/rename.sh`** — the meta feature: `cp -R` then one command renames
  target, `.app`, bundle id, dirs, and file contents.
- **Tests**: swift-testing suite covering model load + status sort ordering.
- **Docs**: this file, `PLAN.md` (index, written for the fresh-copy workflow),
  `PROBLEMS.md`, and `plans/{architecture,build-system,design-system,renaming}.md`.

Gates run: `make check` ✓, `make test` ✓ (3 tests), `make build` ✓ (icon +
signed `.app`), live launch ✓ — both destinations render correctly, app stays
alive across a sidebar switch (no constraint crash).

Design work was driven through the macos-design, typography-designer, and
swiftui-pro skills per `CLAUDE.md`, before and after writing the views.
